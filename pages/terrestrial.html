          <p>
            Terrestrial planets are a type of rocky planet that share similar
            characteristics to Earth. These planets are primarily composed of
            silicate rocks and metals, with a solid surface and relatively thin
            atmospheres compared to gas giants. They are located closer to the
            Sun within a solar system, typically within the inner regions.
            Terrestrial planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars in our
            solar system. They are characterized by their solid surfaces,
            relatively high densities, and lack of significant gas envelopes.
            Terrestrial planets often exhibit features such as mountains,
            valleys, volcanoes, and impact craters, indicating geological
            activity and history.

          <p>
            Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is a haven for life, boasting
            a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers and a mass of about
            5.97 x 10^24 kilograms. Its surface, covering approximately 71%
            water and 29% land, hosts a diverse range of ecosystems vital for
            sustaining biodiversity. Earth's atmosphere, primarily composed of
            nitrogen and oxygen, shields life from harmful solar radiation and
            moderates its climate. While Earth faces environmental challenges
            from human activity, its significance as a unique and habitable
            world underscores the importance of preserving its delicate balance
            for future generations.

          <h2 class="planetname">Mars</h2>
          <p>
            Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a captivating world with
            distinct characteristics. With a diameter of approximately 6,779
            kilometers and a mass of about 6.42 x 10^23 kilograms, Mars is
            smaller and less massive than Earth. Its surface, marked by vast
            plains, towering volcanoes, and deep canyons, is covered by
            rusty-red iron oxide dust and rocks, giving it the nickname the "Red
            Planet." Mars' atmosphere is thin, primarily composed of carbon
            dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon. Despite its thin
            atmosphere, Mars experiences extreme weather conditions, including
            dust storms that can engulf the entire planet for months.

          <h2 class="planetname">Venus</h2>
          <p>
            Venus, often referred to as Earth's "sister planet," orbits the Sun
            as the second planet, sharing some similarities yet stark contrasts.
            With a diameter of approximately 12,104 kilometers and a mass of
            about 4.87 x 10^24 kilograms, Venus is nearly the same size as Earth
            but significantly denser, making it the hottest planet in our solar
            system. Its surface, shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid and
            carbon dioxide, creates a dense greenhouse effect, trapping heat and
            raising temperatures to scorching levels of around 462 degrees
            Celsius (864 degrees Fahrenheit).

          <h2 class="planetname">Mercury</h2>
          <p>
            Mercury, the smallest and innermost planet of our solar system,
            presents a world of extremes within its diminutive size. With a
            diameter of approximately 4,880 kilometers and a mass of about 3.30
            x 10^23 kilograms, Mercury is a rocky, airless world, resembling a
            barren and desolate landscape. Its proximity to the Sun subjects it
            to intense solar radiation and extreme temperature variations,
            ranging from scorching highs of around 430 degrees Celsius (800
            degrees Fahrenheit) on its sunlit side to frigid lows of about -180
            degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) in shadowed craters near
            its poles. Despite its lack of atmosphere, Mercury exhibits a
            complex geological history, marked by rugged terrain, numerous
            impact craters, and expansive plains formed by volcanic activity.
