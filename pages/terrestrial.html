            Terrestrial planets are a type of rocky planet that share similar
            characteristics to Earth. These planets are primarily composed of
            silicate rocks and metals, with a solid surface and relatively thin
            atmospheres compared to gas giants. They are located closer to the
            Sun within a solar system, typically within the inner regions.
            Terrestrial planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars in our
            solar system. They are characterized by their solid surfaces,
            relatively high densities, and lack of significant gas envelopes.
            Terrestrial planets often exhibit features such as mountains,
            valleys, volcanoes, and impact craters, indicating geological
            activity and history.

            Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is a haven for life, boasting
            a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers and a mass of about
            5.97 x 10^24 kilograms. Its surface, covering approximately 71%
            water and 29% land, hosts a diverse range of ecosystems vital for
            sustaining biodiversity. Earth's atmosphere, primarily composed of
            nitrogen and oxygen, shields life from harmful solar radiation and
            moderates its climate. While Earth faces environmental challenges
            from human activity, its significance as a unique and habitable
            world underscores the importance of preserving its delicate balance
            for future generations.
